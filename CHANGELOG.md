### Unreleased

### v0.21.3: 22 May 2024

#### Improvements

- Reuse incremental dialyzer PLT when suggesting specs
- Avoid starting both incremental and old dialyzer

#### Fixes

- Properly clean up incremental dialyzer PLT when a new one is loaded

### v0.21.2: 21 May 2024

#### Improvements

- Improved validation of dialyzer options. Previously invalid options were allowed leading to dialyzer crashes

#### Fixes

- Fixed a crash in incremental dialyzer leading to used memory buildup

### v0.21.1: 8 May 2024

#### Fixes

- Fixed endless loop when expanding incomplete `use` macro
- Fixed crash in incremental dialyzer when dialyze is already in progress
- Fixed crash when rendering metadata to markdown

### v0.21.0: 5 May 2024

#### Highlights

- OTP incremental dialyzer is now the default dialyzing engine on OTP 26+. While slower than ElixirLS dialyzer it is much better at tracking module dependencies and should resolve issues with transient dialyzer warning that do not disappear on recompile. ElixirLS dialyzer is still available and incremental dialyzer can be disabled by config setting `elixirLS.incrementalDialyzer`
- Experimental support for Code actions added. Two code actions are available: Replace unknown remote def, replace an unused variable with an underscore [Samuel Heldak](https://github.com/sheldak)

#### Improvements

- Added a workaround for ExUnit emitting invalid event in case `setup_all` is killed. This error resulted in invalid test results being presented in Test UI
- More apps is now unloaded on recompile. This should improve build consistency
- Underscored variables are now returned in completions and tracked
- All provider code has been moved to ElixirLS repo from elixir_sense. This should make it easier for contributors to navigate in the codebase

#### Fixes

- Fixed a crash in on-type formatting
- Fixed a crash on invalid diagnostic severity emitted by compiler
- Fixed a crash in parser related to race conditions
- Fixed a crash in debugger when only 1 frame was returned
- Fixed selection ranges incompatibility with elixir 1.16.2
- Fixed a crash when logging elixir API error [AJ Foster](https://github.com/aj-foster)
- Fixed a crash in type inference engine related to map keys

#### Potential incompatibilities

- elixir_sense plugin management code has been moved to ElixirLS repo along with all providers. This can potentially affect existing plugins

### v0.20.0: 21 February 2024

#### Highlights

- Selection ranges provider added. This provider handles expand/shrink selection editor commands in a semantic aware way
- Completions, hover and signature help providers now are able to display `@doc` and other attributes data from the currently edited buffer
- Hover provider now returns markdown with working links to hexdocs and erlang documentation. Support for [ExDoc autolinking](https://hexdocs.pm/ex_doc/readme.html#auto-linking) and [erlang see tags](https://www.erlang.org/doc/apps/erl_docgen/inline_tags#%3Csee*%3E---see-tags) has been added

#### Improvements

- Completions provider renders metadata about returned items. Metadata includes info on `since`, `deprecated`, `impl` attributes as well as a number of other flags (hidden, optional, opaque, overridable etc.)
- Completions provider is now able to suggest callbacks and protocol functions defined in the current buffer
- Completions provider is now able to suggest return values when implementing callbacks and protocol functions defined in the current buffer
- Documentation and signatures is provided on builtin function in more cases
- Avoid race conditions when reading mix project in workspace symbols provider
- Avoid a crash in document symbols provider when unable to determine the end of expression
- Avoid a crash when `locals_without_parens` contains invalid elements

### v0.19.0: 21 January 2024

#### Highlights

- On type parsing and diagnostics for phoenix `.heex` files
- Workspace symbols provider has been reimplemented. Previously the workspace symbols index was build from all available symbols. To make it more focused and helpful now only symbols from the project are considered. This change made it much quicker and improved the quality of returned results. Fuzzy matching engine was also improved and made consistent with how complete provider works.

#### Improvements

- Parser is now asynchronous. This should limit the number of cases when providers wait on parsing.
- Function location in workspace symbols provider is optimized. Index build speed should now be much quicker
- Added support for `mise` version manager (the former `rtx` is still supported) - [Robson Roberto Souza Peixoto](https://github.com/robsonpeixoto)
- Workspace symbols provider return results on empty query
- Workspace symbols provider no longer returns duplicated results for functions with default arguments
- Workspace symbols provider now returns `containerName` if applicable
- Workspace symbols provider now returns deprecated symbol tag
- Workspace symbols provider, completions and other providers return distinct symbol kinds for functions and macros. This makes them visually different in editors (e.g VSCode uses different icons)
- Apps are now reloaded after build so application controller can provide an accurate list of modules. This works around https://github.com/elixir-lang/elixir/issues/13001
- App config is now reset on each build. This works around https://github.com/elixir-lang/elixir/issues/13246
- Suggest contracts calls are now non blocking. Previously a call to dialyzer would block the server.
- Diagnostics without `file` set will now be returned as originating from `mix.exs`. Diagnostics without document URI are meaningless in LSP
- Document symbols rendering is improved for defs with multiline arguments - [Milo Lee](https://github.com/oo6)
- Debugger now respects `--no-mix-exs` flag in launch config `taskArgs`
- Do block indentation level discovery is improved in completions provider. This should improve keyword completions position
- Elixir version checks have been optimized in completions provider. Those turned out to be expensive.
- Completions provider now caches modules. This greatly improves responsiveness when completion is invoked off an empty hint
- Completions provider now returns `@nifs` attribute added in elixir 1.16
- Definitions provider now supports resetting aliases `alias: nil` on phoenix router scope

#### Fixes

- Fixed crash when code action is unable to apply spec
- Fixed a crash when loading an old format or unrepairable DETS file
- Operators, functions and macros are now correctly labelled in completions provider. Previously every symbol from `Kernel` was labelled as `keyword` and every completion having a snippet was labelled as `snippet`.
- Fixed a crash in build when printing invalid diagnostics from external compilers
- Fixed a crash in suggest contracts when dialyzer is able to infer concrete types in protocol
- Fixed a crash in completions provider when a completion would be filtered out
- Fixed a crash in document symbols provider when unable to get a line for AST node
- Mix clean custom command will no longer crash when executed in non mix project
- Completions provider returns correct type when a module has functions and macros with the same name. This bug made it return `Application.compile_env` as function instead of macro
- Fixed a crash in phoenix router scopes when code fails to parse
- Fixed a crash in definitions provider when cursor over phoenix controller action in router
- Fixed a crash in definitions provider with nested phoenix scopes. The scope combination algorithm was incorrect and produced invalid aliases

### v0.18.1: 28 December 2023

#### Improvements

- Variables defined in `ex_unit` `test`, `setup` and `setup_all` context are now returned by completions provider. Navigation to variable definition and references now also works correctly
- Suggest spec code lens now emits specs for all arity variants when function has default arguments. Previously only the one with all parameters was emitted
- Missing required OTP `:crypto` module is now detected on startup
- Completions provider is now properly returning quoted remote calls. Previously accepting a suggestion would insert invalid code

#### Fixes

- Fixed regression and crash on `phoenix-heex` files. This problem was introduced in v0.18.0 and broke completions, definition and hover
- Fixed a crash during struct field inspection when the struct cannot be instantiated
- Fixed a crash in implementations provider when behaviour implementation is a delegate or a guard
- Fixed a crash on invalid delegate AST node
- Fixed a crash when incorrect AST resulted in mismatched alias stack pop operations
- Fixed a crash on older elixir versions when compiler diagnostic message is not a binary. This problem was introduced in v0.18.0
- Fixed invalid argument passed to fallback implementation for Apply spec code action
- Workspace symbols provider now correctly navigates to functions with default arguments

### v0.18.0: 22 December 2023

#### Highlights

- Elixir 1.16 support
- Diagnostics provider now returns related info with code positions. This feature works best with elixir 1.16 allowing for navigation to invalid syntax elements like mismatched brackets
- On type parser has been improved and extended. It now keeps a cache of parsed AST and extracted document metadata. Most of the providers has been updated to reuse this metadata eliminating the need for on demand parsing. This should make completions, hover, etc more snappy. The previous implementation was particularly not efficient for completions provider that would parse the file twice for each request
- Phoenix integration improved. Go To Definition can now navigate to controllers when inside a Phoenix scope. Complete suggestions in Phoenix.Router now return controllers and actions [Gustavo Aguiar](https://github.com/gugahoa)

#### Improvements

- Diagnostic provider returns deprecated and not used tags on certain warnings. This allows editors for visually marking code ranges using deprecated APIs and not used code constructs
- Diagnostics are now stored along with document version. Diagnostic publishing algorithm has been improved to prefer recent parser diagnostics over stale build diagnostics.
- Parser is now able to provide diagnostics in `untitled:` schema files based on `languageId` document property
- On type formatting and Folding ranges providers are now disabled on `eex` documents as `eex` was never supported in those providers
- OTP 26 compatibility warning on Windows updated to direct users to install 26.2+ version
- Struct field completions now work on functions returning remote type [sarah kate](https://github.com/sarahkw)
- Type inference from guard expressions added [Nguyễn Văn Đức](https://github.com/Goose97)

#### Fixes

- Fixed crash in document symbols provider on invalid attribute nodes
- Fixed crash on cases where some compiler generates diagnostics with invalid position
- Fixed test lense provider on code using `Elixir` proxy
- Fixed debugger crash when stacktrace frame returns `undefined` instead of arguments list
- Improved LSP compatibility on document synchronization. Previously the document version after applying changes was increased. This bug was present since the initial code release but started causing issues with discarded diagnostics in Helix editor since v0.17.0 started publishing diagnostics with document version
- Fixed invalid result returned from build process when handling error during project reload

#### Potential incompatibilities

- `elixir_ls_debugger` app has been renamed to `debug_adapter` to better reflect that it is not a debugger but an adapter implementing Debug Adapter Protocol. Similarly, the launch scripts has been renamed to `debug_adapter.sh` and `debug_adapter.bat` respectively. Editor extensions and custom launcher scripts may need an update

### v0.17.10: 19 November 2023

#### Improvements

- Improved validation of language server configuration
- Improved validation of debugger launch configuration
- Diagnostics with no file are now emitted on `mix.exs`. Previously they were skipped

- Completions should be able to infer struct and map keys in more cases when variable is a result of function returning struct or map
- ElixirLS will refuse to start if unable to create its files. This should limit the number of cases when server starts in faulty state

#### Fixes

- Fixed crash in completions when attribute expands to atom not being an elixir module
- Fixed crash in completions when map has capitalized atom keys
- Fixed crash on invalid alias expressions
- Fixed crash when suggestion a variable that is known to be a struct
- Removed 5s timeout on writing debugger output. This led to crashes under heavy load
- Fixed language server crash when diagnostic use `IO.chardata` file location

### v0.17.8: 9 November 2023

#### Improvements

- RTX activation in launch script now uses `env -s` instead of `activate` [Walton Hoops](https://github.com/Whoops)
- Language server is now more resilient when cwd changes. Workaround added for elixir issue when Path.expand would unnecessarily evaluate File.cwd!
- Tracer should now be able to recover when DETS files are corrupted
- elixir_sense plugin crash is now handled and should not prevent completions

#### Fixes

- Fixed crash in debugger when on_load fails during module interpreting
- Fixed crash in completions due to missing regex escapes
- Fixed crash in document symbols on invalid typespec

- Fixed crash in completions when callbacks from typespecs do not match those from docs

### v0.17.5: 31 October 2023

#### Improvements

- Invalid environment variables config is now raised as message. Previously it would crash the server
- Compile tracer is more error tolerant. It should now handle invalid DETS files and missing directories
- Dialyzer is more error tolerant - it should now be able to recover from broken beam files on elixir 1.14+

#### Fixes

- Fixed crash when mix is unable to load deps. Loading of deps should now emit diagnostics
- Fixed crash in complete when editing a map/struct
- Fixed a crash in parser on `untitled:` schema files
- Fixed a crash when emitting diagnostics and cwd is not present

### v0.17.4: 30 October 2023

#### Improvements

- Dialyzer will now store beams in separate directories for each elixir/OTP combo. This should limit number of errors due to beam errors

- Various cases of current directory usage fixed. This should improve stability during build when cwd changes
- All references to `Mix.Project` moved under a build lock or made go through cache. This should improve stability during build when Mix.Project stack changes
- Fix error prone usages of `String.starts_with?` as a way of checking if file is in directory
- Language server made more stable with `autoBuild` disabled

### v0.17.3: 24 October 2023

#### Fixes

- Fixed crash when language server tried to respond to cancelled requests. The bug was longstanding but changes from v0.17.2 exposed it

### v0.17.0: 11 October 2023

#### Highlights

- Language Server now emit parser errors and warnings on type in .ex, .exs and .eex files
- Language Server provides better completions for elixir reserved words. Thanks [Kevin Kalb](https://github.com/kkalb) for initial work
- Debugger now automatically breaks on `Kernel.dbg` macro. This allows inspecting variables, evaluating expressions and stepping through piped function calls. A setting `breakOnDbg` defaulting to `true` can be used to turn off that behaviour
- Progress reports and cancel support added in debugger. This can be used to terminate long running evaluate requests.
- Improved rendering of documentation in hover provider
- Improved support for Unicode identifiers and atoms. Elixir supports Unicode identifiers since v1.5 and now all ElixirLS features should work with them

#### Improvements

- Added support for fish shell [Sergey Kislyakov](https://github.com/Defman21)
- Consistently render parens for basic types in Suggest Contracts Code Lense and markdown
- Debugger should now be better at handling some common crashes
- Debugger now optimistically translates erlang versioned variable names to elixir names
- Debugger emits better warnings when modules cannot be interpreted
- Debugger can be launched with `"noDebug": true`. This allows `Run Without Debugging` in VSCode
- Debugger will now emit exit code via `exited` DAP event. This allows tracking mix task result in debug session e.g. when running tests
- New setting added to debugger `exitAfterTaskReturns`, defaulting to `true` - controls wether to end debug session when mix task returns
- Language server will now reset cwd to project root after interrupted build
- All ElixirLS dependencies are now vendored and should not conflict with client project dependencies
- ElixirLS unloads deps used during startup and compilation
- *nix launch scripts has been refactored and split into dedicated bash, fish, zsh [Florian Neumann](https://github.com/florianb)
- A workaround for elixir formatter accidentally compiling the project has been implemented
- Language fences added in complete/signature/hover provided markdown fragments
- Language server stability should be improved by unloading project's applications. This works around elixir not updating application controller state after recompilation
- Completions provider is now able to suggest keyword params on macros. Previously only functions was supported
- Added `float` to list of bitstring modifiers in completions provider

#### Fixes

- Debugger will not allow mix task with a `/`
- A bug preventing `do` completion when there's a whitespace after cursor has been fixed
- Document symbol provider will not crash when unable to get selection location for AST node
- Signature provider now highlights the correct parameter in calls with default arguments when default arguments are not after required ones
- Completions now work correctly after Unicode characters
- Do not error if client returns `null` to `workspace/configuration` reverse request
- Fixed a crash when getting a parameter name from complex parameter type. This bug made completions on `:pg` module fail.
- Fixed invalid aliases in scope inference when a submodule `__MODULE__.Some` is used

#### Potential incompatibilities

- Debugger will terminate the debug session and return result code when mix task returns. Previously, debugger would continue running. If the new behavior is not wanted, please set `exitAfterTaskReturns` to `false` in your launch configuration
- `debugExpressionTimeoutMs` debugger launch configuration setting no longer has any effect. DAP `cancel` request can now be used to terminate long running debugger evaluate requests.
- Debugger will now auto break on `Kernel.dbg` macro. If this is not intended consider setting `breakOnDbg` to `false` in your launch configuration

### v0.16.0: 19 August 2023

#### Highlights

- Added support for [rtx](https://github.com/jdxcode/rtx) version manager.
- Language server now returns diagnostics in config files for current configuration. Previously when there were compilation errors in config files an error with stacktrace would be returned on `mix.exs` instead of the config file.
- Configuration management has been refactored and migrated to pull based approach. This addresses recent problem on VSCode when the server would start with default settings after a restart. Pull based `workspace/configuration` request has been added in LSP 3.6 and the pull based `workspace/didChangeConfiguration` with params is deprecated.
- Language server now uses call arity in definition, implementation, references and hover providers. This means that if there are multiple arity variants, the documentation for correct ones will be presented. In case of incomplete code all variants with arity greater or equal to the number of arguments are considered.

#### Improvements

- Debugger is now able to set breakpoints in multiple modules in case one line maps to many modules
- Completions provider will now trigger signature help when accepting a completion with 0-arity function when there higher arity versions available.
- Completions provider will now trigger signature help when accepting a completion with a typespec of arity greater than 0.
- Mix project modules pruning is more robust. This should address some rare crashes e.g. when `deps` directory is removed during a build.
- Logger interception is more robust. This should address some rare crashes observed on elixir 1.15.
- Install script no longer unnecessarily starts and stops applications. This should improve launch time.
- On Unix systems launch script now uses `SHELL` environment variable to decide if it should prefer bash or zsh. Previously, bash was preferred.
- Providers now rely on parser `token_metadata` when determining module and functions scopes. This allows for more accurate suggestions. Previous implementation was not able to provide module attribute completions inside module body when there were defs after the cursor.
- Language server now provides documentation for builtin module attributes in hover and completions providers [Nguyễn Văn Đức](https://github.com/Goose97).
- Hover provider returns documentation on reserved words and variables.
- References provider is now able to find references to functions and module in current file. Previously only compiled modules were scanned for references.
- Hover provider returns simple documentation for functions, typespecs and modules from the current file. Previously nothing was returned and a crash was logged.
- Completions provider returns signatures for typespecs defined in current file.
- Improved handling of defs with default params in signature help. Now only head signature is returned.
- Language server is now able to provide signatures from behaviour or protocol in many cases.
- Definition and references provider are now able to return result on variable remote calls when variable is known to be a module.
- References provider is now able to track variable references outside of modules.
- Improved type inference when variable is reassigned.
- Providers consider local macros only after definition. This should improve correctness and reduce number of invalid completions.
- Improved handling of `alias` and `require` with `warn:` option.

#### Fixes

- Fixed crash in debugger when setting a function breakpoint on not existing function
- Setting breakpoints in `Inspect` protocol implementations is now forbidden. This protocol is used internally and hitting a breakpoint resulted in deadlock.
- Debugger no longer interprets `JsonV.Encoder` protocol (a vendored version of `Json.Encoder`) used internally.
- Fixed a case when completions provider would return only 1 variant of a function with multiple arities.
- Completion and signature providers correctly return multiple `@spec` clauses. Previously only the first one was formatted properly.
- Changing settings no longer results in notification about changed mix target.
- `ELS_ELIXIR_OPTS` environment variable was not correctly word split when passed to elixir command.
- Fixed a crash when launching debugger with default mix task (equivalent of running `mix`).
- Completions provider suggests aliased structs after `%` [Nguyễn Văn Đức](https://github.com/Goose97)
- Completions provider no longer returns `@@`.
- Fixed a crash in completion provider when type in callback matched local without parens.
- Improved `Mix.Task` module subtype detection. Previously are submodules of `Mix.Tasks` were considered. Now only ones exporting `run/1`. This error resulted in unnecessary completions.
- Fixed a case when completions provider would suggest additional edit with `alias Elixir`.
- Fixed a case when completions provider would suggest `Elixir.Elixir` [Nguyễn Văn Đức](https://github.com/Goose97)
- Correctly return `alias` subtype in completions provider when suggesting an alias. Previously module was returned even if such module does not exist.
- Completions provider suggests alias for all matched module parts. Previously only first match was considered.
- Completions provider no longer suggests alias when the hint has more than one part. This means that additional edits with aliases will not be returned after `Some.Module.`.
- Type of pinned variables is now correctly inferred [Nguyễn Văn Đức](https://github.com/Goose97)
- Fixed AST parsing of protocol implementations without `for:`.
- Fixed a case when definition provider was unable to locate variables inside multiline struct.
- Implementation provider works with macrocallback implementations.
- Fixed endless recursion when expanding `use` macro. This caused definition provider to hang when navigating to `Kernel` functions/macros.
- Fixed rendering of docs for builtin typespecs.
- Fixed a crash with definition provider over `__MODULE__`.
- Fixed a case in AST parser when `@spec` or `@callback` would get overwritten. Now all definitions are collected.
- Fixed rare crashes on elixir 1.15 with cursor over submodule of an attribute or variable.
- Signature provider no longer reveals details of `@opaque` typespecs.
- Fixed order of signatures in completions provider.
- Fix signature render of erlang functions with multiple EIP48 documentation entries (e.g. `:erlang.system_info/1`).
- Fixed render of callback signatures. Previously they were marked as `@spec`, now `@callback` or `@macrocallback`.
- No parens locals are no longer treated as calls on elixir 1.15+.
- Fixed cases when crash in AST parser would produce invalid metadata.
- Fixed crash in completions with nested dot expression on elixir 1.15.
- Fixed AST parsing when `quote` was used as variable.

#### Potential incompatibilities

- The language server will get configuration `workspace/configuration` if the client supports it. Previously it relied on `workspace/didChangeConfiguration` notification.

### v0.15.1: 29 June 2023

#### Improvements

- This is the first release supporting OTP 26. Unfortunately due to bugs in OTP only 26.0.2+ is supported. See [886](https://github.com/elixir-lsp/elixir-ls/issues/886) and [923](https://github.com/elixir-lsp/elixir-ls/pull/923) for details

#### Fixes

- Fixed crash when handling `workspace/didChangeWatchedFiles` when `project_dir` not yet set
- ExUnit test tracer is now under build lock. This should fix crashes due tu race conditions
- Fixed completion of remote calls matching locals without parens (e.g. `Map.drop` when `drop` is local without parens from `ecto_sql`) [Milo Lee](https://github.com/oo6)

### v0.15.0: 20 June 2023

#### Improvements

- This is the first release supporting Elixir 1.15. See [898](https://github.com/elixir-lsp/elixir-ls/pull/898) for details
- Main distribution mode switched to `Mix.install` script. This allows running ElixirLS built with a correct combination of OTP and elixir. Previously used `.ez` releases suffered from numerous problems stemming from version incompatibilities (e.g. [193](https://github.com/elixir-lsp/elixir-ls/issues/193))
- elixir_sense replaced many of its custom source parsing internals with elixir 1.13+ Code.Fragment APIs
- `require` and `import` are now understood by elixir_sense. This improves accuracy of definition, hover, references and complete providers. For example only imports matching `only` and `except` options will now be suggested by complete provider.
- When accepting a completion with a not required macro a `require` directive will be now added to module.
- Reimplemented `use` macro expansion. This should improve accuracy.
- Better handling of typespecs in elixir_sense. This should improve accuracy in modules with defs and types sharing the same name.
- Added ability to pass command line options to elixir and erlang via `ELS_ELIXIR_OPTS` and `ELS_ERL_OPTS`. This allows for setting a node name and connecting remotely to language server and debugger.

#### Fixes

- Fixed a longstanding bug with formatter not respecting `.formatter.exs` when code is compiling (requires elixir 1.15) [Thomas Depierre](https://github.com/DianaOlympos)

- Fixed completions of records defined in the same file
- Fixed support for `alias __MODULE__`
- Silent crashes in dialyzer fixed
- Document symbol provider now does not crash on incomplete typespec
- Debugger now properly tracks running processes. Previously UI was not updated when new processes start or running not monitored processes exit
- Debugger now respects `MIX_TARGET` environment variable
- Undefined function diagnostics no longer emitted from `mix.exs` dependencies. Elixir `mix` swallows those warnings since 1.10
- Builds now use `--all-warnings` flag on `mix compile`. This should result in more predictable diagnostics in umbrella apps.
- Completion provider returns typespecs for struct properties in documentation if struct module defines type `t()`
- Debugger now returns type of breakpoint in the hit event as required by DAP
- Fixed crash when elixir-ls is run in a directory without `mix.exs`
- References provider now can find references to elixir modules. Previously modules were found only when a function or macro from that module was called
- Typespecs from behaviour module are used on callback implementations in completions, hover and specification providers
- `@after_verify` attribute added in elixir 1.14 is recognized as builtin
- Fixed edge cases when private def would overshadow a public one
- Quoted expressions are now skipped when code AST is analyzed. There is low chance anything useful can be extracted from them
- Submodule implicit alias behavior is now correctly implemented. This should improve quality in various providers
- Fixed crash in references provider when reference does not have a line (e.g. in phoenix live views)

### Refactorings

- Mix Formatter now properly formats elixir-ls code from the top directory
- Major refactoring of elixir-ls server driven by [Steve Cohen](https://github.com/scohen) is under way. It's not yet complete and can be tested by enabling experimental server. Thanks to others involved ([Scott Ming](https://github.com/scottming), [Samuel Hełdak](https://github.com/sheldak))
- Language server now runs with consolidated protocols. Consolidation is disabled on each build with `--no-protocol-consolidation` flag on `mix compile`. This should make the server faster. The side effect is more protocol consolidation warnings printed to the console on elixir < 1.14.

#### Deprecations

- This is the last release supporting elixir 1.12

### v0.13.0: 8 January 2023

#### Improvements

- Completions now return LSP 3.17 `labelDetails`. This allows to provide more contextual details to completion items

  - This changes the language id's `EEx`->`eex` and `HTML (EEx)`->`html-eex`
  - If you have customized your emmet configuration configuration then you need to update it:
  - Open VSCode and hit `Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P` and type `"Preference: Open Settings (JSON)"`
  - Add or edit your `emmet.includedLanguages` to include the new Language Id:
```json
"emmet.includeLanguages": {
  "html-eex": "html"
}
```

If you have eex file associations in your settings.json then remove them:
```
"files.associations": {
  "*.html.eex": "HTML (EEx)", // remove this
  "*.html.leex": "HTML (EEx)" // remove this
},
```

- Print PATH to developer console if "elixir" command fails
- Fix Dialyzer crash when some modules are undialyzable

### v0.2.20: 13 Jul 2018

- Fix autocomplete bugs when typing in parentheses
- Copy latest syntax highlighting from fr1zle/vscode-elixir
- Handle `subdirectories` and `import_deps` in `.formatter.exs`. Requires the latest Elixir (1.6.5), which you can install via kiex with `kiex install master` prior to its release.

- New feature: Automatically fetch deps when compiling. Set `elixirLS.fetchDeps` to `false` to disable
- New feature: Incremental text synchronization
- Minor improvements to autocomplete and automatic block closing

- ** ACCEPT AUTOCOMPLETE SUGGESTIONS WITH TAB INSTEAD OF ENTER.** See readme for an explanation of why. You can change it back if you really want.
- Change default settings to automatically trim trailing whitespace and add newline at end of file

### v0.2.14: 3 Mar 2018

- Fix failures to launch in some projects

- Fix restart button in debugger

### v0.2.11: 31 Jan 2018

- Improve syntax highlighting (Thanks to @TeeSeal)

### v0.2.10: 24 Jan 2018

- Fix builds and related features on Windows

### v0.2.9: 29 Nov 2017

- Fix autocomplete not firing after "."

### v0.2.8: 29 Nov 2017

- Add auto-indentation rules (copied from
  [fr1zle/vscode-elixir](https://github.com/fr1zle/vscode-elixir))
- Disable `editor.quickSuggestions` by default so autocomplete suggestions are
  triggered automatically only when after a ".". This is nice because the
  language server irritatingly tries to auto-complete things like "do" or "else"
  if they come at the end of a line.
- Add configuration option "mixEnv" to set the Mix environment used when
  compiling. It now defaults to "test" instead of "dev" to aid in TDD and to
  avoid interfering with the Phoenix dev server.
- Add configuration option "projectDir" for when your Mix project is in a
  subdirectory instead of the workspace root.
- Add debug launch configuration option "env" to set environment variables
  (including `MIX_ENV`)
- Add debug launch configuration option "excludeModules" to avoid interpreting
  modules. This is important if for modules that contain NIFs which can't be
  debugged.

### v0.2.7: 9 Nov 2017

- Read formatter options from `.formatter.exs` in project root instead of
  including line length in extension config options

### v0.2.6: 3 Nov 2017

- Don't focus Output pane on errors because request handler errors are common
  and recoverable

### v0.2.5: 3 Nov 2017

- Improve error output in debugger and fix failures to launch debugger

### v0.2.4: 25 Oct 2017

- Package ElixirLS as .ez archives instead of escripts. This should make `asdf`
  installs work.
- Fix debugger error logging when initialize fails
- Fix timeouts when calling back into the language server with build or dialyzer
  results

### v0.2.3: 24 Oct 2017

- Fix failing debugger launch
- Fix segfaults in OTP 20 caused by regexes precompiled in OTP 19

### v0.2.2: 19 Oct 2017

### v0.2.1: 19 Oct 2017

- Fix bug where deps are recompiled after every change
- Update README
- Update syntax highlighting (merged from fr1zle/vscode-elixir)

### v0.2.0: 17 Oct 2017

- Rewritten build system to make use of Elixir 1.6 compiler diagnostics
- Code formatting in Elixir 1.6
- Automatic dialyzer server in Erlang/OTP 20
- Lots and lots of refactoring

### v0.0.9: 23 Jun 2017

- Revert to building with Erlang OTP 19.2 instead of 20.0. It seems that
  escripts built with 20.0 won't run on 19.2 runtimes.
- Fix handling of Windows paths with non-default drive letter

### v0.0.8: 23 Jun 2017

- Enable setting breakpoints in Erlang modules

### v0.0.7: 12 Jun 2017

- Fix launching of debugger on OSX (when working directory is not set to the
  extension directory)
- Fix launching of language server when Elixir is installed with "asdf" tool.
  (Fix in 0.0.6 didn't actually work)

### v0.0.6: 12 Jun 2017

- Handle Elixir installations that were done via the "asdf" tool

### v0.0.5: 11 Jun 2017

- Windows support

### v0.0.4: 10 Jun 2017

- Updated ElixirLS to package its apps as escripts and updated client to handle
  it. This should fix the error `(Mix) Could not start application language_server: could not find application file: language_server.app`.
  Windows, however, is still broken.
- Began a changelog :)
