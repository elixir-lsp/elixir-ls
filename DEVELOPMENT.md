# Version Support Guidelines

Elixir itself supports 5 versions with security updates:

OTP Supports the last 3 versions:
http://erlang.2086793.n4.nabble.com/OTP-Versions-and-Maint-Branches-td4722416.html

ElixirLS generally aims to support the last 3 versions of Elixir and the last 3 versions of OTP. However this is not a hard and fast rule and may change in the future.

# Debugging

If you're debugging a running server than `IO.inspect` is a good approach, any messages you create with it will be sent to your LSP client as a log message

To debug in tests you can use `IO.inspect(Process.whereis(:user), message, label: "message")` to send your output directly to the group leader of the test process.
