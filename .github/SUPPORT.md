# Support

Thank you for using ElixirLS! :tada:

This document offers some guidelines when asking for support related to an
issues that you might encounter when using ElixirLS.

## Guidelines

These are some general guidelines to follow when reaching out through any of the
available support channels.

1. **Search through the existing
   [issues](https://github.com/elixir-lsp/elixir-ls/issues/) before opening a new
   one**

   Also check [elixir\_sense issues](https://github.com/elixir-lsp/elixir_sense/issues)
   and [vscode-elixir-ls issues](https://github.com/elixir-lsp/vscode-elixir-ls/issues)

   Check if one already exists related to the issue you are having. Remember
   to include `closed` issues as well.

2. **Provide as much context and information as possible**

   It is much more likely that others will be able to help you if they can
   reproduce the issue your are experiencing.

3. **Be nice**

   This can be applied to life in general, but it's especially important when
   communicating only through written text.
